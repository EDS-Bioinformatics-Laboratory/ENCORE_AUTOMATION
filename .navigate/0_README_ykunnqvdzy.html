<h3>CODE</h3>
<p><u><em>Explanation</em></u>:</p>
<p><em>This directory contains the code you use (and developed) as part of this project.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Clean code</em></strong> </p>
<p><em>Write programs for people, not computers (code should be easily read and understood). Adopting clean code practices helps to standardize and organize software code in order to enhance readability. This allows developers to concentrate on core functionality and reduce errors.</em> <em>Readability helps reproducibility and transparency</em>. </p>
<p><em>A few general rules:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Reduce complexity. Decompose programs into functions and modules (instead of making very long scripts).</em></li>
<li><em>Limit number of function arguments and length of functions.</em></li>
<li><em>Be ruthless about eliminating duplication (use functions).</em></li>
<li><em>Always search for well-maintained software libraries that do what you need, and test these libraries  before relying on them.</em></li>
<li><em>Do not comment and  uncomment sections of code to control a program's behaviour. This is a recipe for making your software irreproducible.</em> </li>
<li><em>Choose a style guide—And stick with it (see for example, https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/ or https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs109l/unrestricted/resources/google-style.html)</em></li>
<li><em>Give functions and variables meaningful names.</em></li>
<li><em>Make dependencies and requirements explicit</em></li>
<li>
<p><em>Refactor as needed (process of restructuring your code without changing its interface).</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Write error messages that provide solutions or point to your documentation.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Code testing</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Interrogate specific and isolated coding behaviour to reduce coding errors and ensure intended functionality, especially as code increases in complexity. Describe if software tests have been performed and how to re-run these tests.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Integrated development environment</strong> (IDE)</em></p>
<p><em>Consider using an IDE, e.g., PyCharm and DataSpell from JetBrains (https://www.jetbrains.com/), RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/)</em> </p>
<p><em><strong>Write comments as you code (not afterwards).</strong> Modern IDEs will often automatically generate documentation strings as you write code, which removes the burden of having to remember to write comments. (e.g., PyCharm, DataSpell).</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Automated documentation tools</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Consider the use of documentation tools to partially automate the generation of documentation. For example, using Python docstrings (https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/) together with Sphinx https://www.sphinx-doc.or) to automatically generate documentation.</em> </p>
<p><em><u>Instructions</u>:</em> </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Remove all Instructions and the Explanation once you have completed the template.</em></li>
<li><em>Level of detail: Information provided should be sufficient for someone who was not involved in the project and/or has limited knowledge about the topic,  to understand and reproduce the project.</em> </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Software documentation</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Ensure that you have properly documented your code.</em> <em>Not all types of software documentation on this list need to be written for a single research or support project but a combination of several should be selected depending on the nature of the project. Whether more or less documentation is needed for your project will depend on its scale and complexity. For a research project you need at least to write (external) source code documentation and user documentation.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Requirements Specification</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Software Design</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>(External) source code documentation</em></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Place a brief explanatory comment at the start of every program.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Document the input and output of your script/functions.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Describe what the code is doing and why.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Testing Requirements</em></p>
</li>
<li><strong><em>End-User Instructions (including a quick-start guide)</em></strong></li>
<li><em>How to install and configure the software.</em></li>
<li><em>Where to find its full documentation.</em></li>
<li><em>Examples of how to execute the code to produce certain output. Provide a simple example or test dataset.</em></li>
<li><em>Under what license it’s released.</em></li>
<li><em>Include a help command for command line interfaces</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Version control your documentation.</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Keep your documentation inside your Git repository along with the rest of your files. In addition/alternatively ‘Read the Docs’ (https://readthedocs.org/) provides an approach for hosting and automatically building documentation.</em> </p>
<p><strong>Preserve your computing environment</strong></p>
