<h3>NOTEBOOKS</h3>
<p><u><em>Explanation</em></u>:</p>
<p>A notebook is <em>a (web-based) interactive computing platform</em> that combines live code, equations, narrative text, visualizations etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Tell a story for an audience</strong> (rather than sporadic notes).</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Use cell divisions to make steps clear.</em></strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>Build a pipeline.</strong> Notebooks documenting initial, exploratory investigations will rarely be widely generalizable, but once a stable analysis approach has been identified, a well-designed notebook can be generalized into a pipeline that easily repeats that analysis using different input data and parameters. With this end in mind, design your notebook from the beginning to allow such future repurposing.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Clean code</em></strong> </p>
<p><em>Write programs for people, not computers (code should be easily read and understood). Adopting clean code practices helps to standardize and organize software code in order to enhance readability. This allows developers to concentrate on core functionality and reduce errors.</em> </p>
<p><em>A few general rules:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Reduce complexity. Decompose programs into functions and modules (instead of making very long scripts).</em></li>
<li><em>Limit number of function arguments and length of functions.</em></li>
<li><em>Be ruthless about eliminating duplication (use functions).</em></li>
<li><em>Always search for well-maintained software libraries that do what you need, and test these libraries     before relying on them.</em></li>
<li><em>Do not comment and  uncomment sections of code to control a program's behaviour. This is a recipe for making your software irreproducible.</em> </li>
<li><em>Choose a style guide—And stick with it (see for example, https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/ or https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs109l/unrestricted/resources/google-style.html)</em></li>
<li><em>Give functions and variables meaningful names.</em></li>
<li><em>Make dependencies and requirements explicit</em></li>
<li>
<p><em>Refactor as needed (process of restructuring your code without changing its interface).</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Write error messages that provide solutions or point to your documentation.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Code testing</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Interrogate specific and isolated coding behaviour to reduce coding errors and ensure intended functionality, especially as code increases in complexity. Describe if software tests performed and how to re-run these tests.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Integrated development environment</strong> (IDE)</em></p>
<p><em>Consider using an IDE (integrated development environment (IDE; )e.g., PyCharm and DataSpell from JetBrains (https://www.jetbrains.com/), RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/)</em> </p>
<p><em><strong>Write comments as you code (not afterwards).</strong> Modern integrated development environments (IDEs) will often automatically generate documentation strings as you write code, which removes the burden of having to remember to write comments. (e.g., PyCharm, DataSpell).</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Automated documentation tools</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Consider the use of documentation tools to partially automate the generation of documentation. For example, using Python docstrings (https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/) together with Sphinx https://www.sphinx-doc.or) to automatically generate documentation.</em> </p>
<p><em><u>Instructions</u>:</em> </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Remove all Instructions and the Explanation once you have completed the template.</em></li>
<li>
<p><em>Level of detail: Information provided should be sufficient for someone who was not involved in the project and/or has limited knowledge about the topic,  to understand and reproduce the project.</em> </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>This directory contains, for example, R and Jupyter notebooks</em></p>
</li>
<li><em>Notebooks can contain a lot of data, figures, and tables. Make sure to minimize your notebook before synchronizing with GitHub.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Software documentation</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Not all types of software documentation on this list need to be written for a single research or support project but a combination of several should be selected depending on the nature of the project. Whether more or less documentation is needed for your project will depend on its scale and complexity. For research project we need at least the (external) source code documentation and user documentation.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Requirements Specification</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Software Design</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>(External) source code documentation</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Place a brief explanatory comment at the start of every program.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Document the input and output of your script/functions.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Describe what the code is doing and why.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Testing Requirements</em></p>
</li>
<li><em>End-User Instructions (including a quick-start guide)</em></li>
<li><em>How to install and configure the software.</em></li>
<li><em>Where to find its full documentation.</em></li>
<li><em>Include examples how to execute the code to produce certain output. Provide a simple example or test dataset.</em></li>
<li><em>Under what license it’s released.</em></li>
<li><em>Include a help command for command line interfaces</em></li>
</ul>
