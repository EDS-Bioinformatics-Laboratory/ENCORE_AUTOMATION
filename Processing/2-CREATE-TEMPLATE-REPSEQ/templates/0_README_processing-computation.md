**Software environment** (alternatively can be specified in \Processing\0_SoftwareEnvironment)

To specify (not implemented yet)

* **Operating System(s) / version(s) used during development (and testing): **

Linux: Ubuntu 22.04 and Debian 12

* **Specific hardware requirements:**

* **Software environment (e.g., programming language + version):** 

Python 3

Versions of other software is documented in ./Results/versions/

**Conceptual description of methodology** 

See ./Code/<ANALYSIS_NAME>/README.md

*Subdirectories*

* ***Code**. Contains the (in-house developed) software used for the computational analysis.*
* ***CodeDocumentation**. Any external documentation that is available about the software such as requirement specifications, software design, source code documentation, testing requirements, and end-user instructions. Alternatively, part of this documentation can be placed in the code itself, or in the code 0_README.md file.*
* ***Data**. Raw, meta, and pre-processed data.*
* ***Notebooks**. Contains interactive notebooks (e.g, R or Jupyter notebooks), which may include data and results. Minimize the size of the Notebook prior to pushing to GitHub.*
* ***Results**. (Intermediate) results such as figures and tables from the computational analysis. Additional sub-directories within \Results, to organize the results, are allowed.* 
* ***Settings.*** 
  * json files with parameters for the analysis (used by the script ./Code/reseda/RUN-RESEDA.py)
